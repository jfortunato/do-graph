# DigitalOcean Graph

Display a graph of your DigitalOcean droplet resource usage using the DigitalOcean API.

## What

This is a simple web application that uses the DigitalOcean API to get the resource usage of your droplets and display it in a graph.

## Why

Maybe your system administrator is the only one who has access to the DigitalOcean account, but you want to allow others to see the resource usage of the droplets.

## How

1. Obtain a DigitalOcean API token.
2. Obtain the IDs of the droplets you want to monitor.
3. Enter the API token and droplet IDs on the [hosted application](https://jfortunato.github.io/do-graph).
